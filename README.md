## 1. Design History
Version 1.0

Produced by Matthew Sides, Sam Dearing, Luke Bruni, Luke Shead and Joe William

01/11/2017

## 2. Management

### 2.1 Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “GreenHouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### 2.2 Scope

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “GreenHouse Menace”. The App is for a target age of 12-15 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and inteactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

### 2.3 Cost

The development will be carried out on PC so no license will be required whatsoever. Unity Pro, the game engine that the app will be developed on, costs £125 a month per person, to the subtotal of £625 and taking into consideration of the amount of time needed to develop the game, which was two weeks brings the cost to £1,250

##### 2.9.1 Project Definition
Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.

![Burndown Chart](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Burndown%20Chart.PNG)

#### 2.9.3 Monday 2nd October - 8th October
We first started with a 1 hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45 minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.

## 3. Design

### 2.4 The Planning

In order to get the correct product to the client, the team met up and made sure that we were all on the same page when it came to the same IDE's we would be using to the the right programming language and what timetable that we would have. We met on serveral occasions regarding points about the app and how it would work, the first meeting was for information on the project, this was followed by a pitch meeting, this was where we had a design for our app. Through our presentation we where able to accurately show how the app was going to work, this allowed for feedback in what was good and bad in our app and we where able to use that for improvement to the app.

Before meetings there where some issues with the powerpoint presentation as it had been created in google docs then transferred over to Microsoft PowerPoint, however those problems where managed to be fixed before the pitch had started. As well as this the group made handouts for the clients to make sure that any information that was missed or not communicated properly would still be showed to the client. With these handouts we where able to resolve an issue with the app before it was too late to have any big inpact on the design process.

After meeting we made sure to cover all of the risks and problems that we could encounter on the project. For example if someone was to have issues with a certain part of building the program, would there be help from the team and if so, was there flexability within the group to help. We took these risk into consideration and tried to make technical solutions to each of them. With us doing this it meant that most of the risks that could have been prevented were, this process saved much time and recources and allowed us to use our time much more effectively in the project.

### 2.5 Feedback

On parts of the ZSL project, there were meetings on the project to show what the app was looking like and if it was going in the right direction of what they wanted. The feedback that our group got on the first pitch was very eye-opening as it showed us that we had been going in a wrong direction with our app. The feedback that we got that our app was not informative enough and interactive sides of it were lacking allowed us to look back at our app and make changes to the app to fit the clients needs. This included changing the interactive side of it completely as well as adding in more parts to make it more informational.

### 3.5 Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

#### 3.5.1 Menu and Game A.I

The project app had its age group towards 11-16 with more emphasis towards the KS3 pupils, so the design we figured called for something that was cartoony and bright, mainly to appeal to said younger audience, but was more modern and reflects on the image of ZSL, which should appeal more to the older KS4, if not the public. The design we figured would work would be a more comic book style, which should appeal to the audience. Other elements would also reflect the image of ZSL but wouldn’t obstruct the original aesthetic of the app.

The menu would be fairly easy to look at and simple to use. The bright vivid colours and the comic book style in the background (The landscapes in the picture are evident of the style) help with the overall design and should appeal to the younger audience, eye catching and not at all dull. The menu elements reflect on more modern designs and generally makes that app appear neater, but as stated, doesn’t interrupt the comic book style design. The greenhouse gas meter would be present mostly and will change based on pupils’ choices of greenhouse reduction, with the lock allowing them to access the “Reduction constructor” and the pledges page once a section has been completed.

![HUD](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Game%20HUD%20Mockup.png)

This shows the game’s UI, again using the design mentioned above. The user would have to try to find all 12 of the carbon emissions or “Hazards” in 5 minutes. Once the “Hazard” is found and selected, it will stand out from the rest of the elements and information will appear, giving a brief explanation of how the “Hazard” is contributing to carbon and greenhouse emissions or other factors of climate change and may impact on the greenhouse gas meter at the top. The elements will be hidden specifically to be enjoyable to the user and not at all too challenging.

### 3.6 Story 

The story relates to the green house gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing proccess of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacutring proccess or segments of the green house gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the proccess once. Moreover once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which green house gases are emmitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### 3.7 Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### 3.8 Application Structure

The Menu will consist of four images, each representating a different area or enviroment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

![Game Menu](https://github.com/LukeShead/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Mockup%20App%20Menu.png)

Furthermore the graphic styles within the enviroments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production proccess of a product relevant to that enviroment. Moreover after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous draggable images, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the green house gas chain has been compeleted and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released,with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### 3.9 Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and  straightforward discussion  (as to what should be inputted).

### 3.10 Genre

	2D

	Educational

	Memory Game

### 3.11 Intended Audience

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.

### 3.12 Sound Consideration

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client(no sound or audio).

### 3.13 Language

The only language avaliable in the game will be english. 

## 4. Game Mechanics | In-Game Elements

### 4.1 Camera

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges  and chain.

### 4.2 General Movement

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### 4.3 Fonts

Ingame Font: 
Jupiter (Menu,Game Screen)
.... (Comic Font)


## 5. Evaluation
### 5.1 How User and Software Requirements Have Been Addressed
When a development methodology has been declared, structuring the work is then the issue. Within Agile Development, the work is divided into four sections to bring the structure of the project. The structure is this:

* Epic - The large body of work and mainly the main objective. Within this are stories.
* Stories - Small work units or tasks that are done to make up the epic.
* Version - The release of the software
* Sprint - The iteration where the team then come together to work.

Using these sections helps break down the requirements and lays them out into workable parts for the software teams. In addition, it can help with prioitzing customer feedback and can change the plan around without having a negative impact.

Epics are the larger bodies that the stories are contained in and make up. Versions are made from different epics being a point in time to where the software is released. These can change over the course of the project being part of agile development and are created through the development and feedback, where the user stories are added, changed or removed to optimize a the release time.

### 5.2 Tools and Techniques used in the design and delivery
* Breaking down a problem/decomposition - Understanding the problem and breaking it down into individual tasks or aims by going from the best ideas from members of the team.

* Trial and error - Working with different ideas and methods and continue through thick and thin until a more desired solution is met.

* Teamwork and communication - Working within a team to achieve a set goal, along with communicating with others about the task at hand or offering suggestions to aid the development.

### 5.3 Motivational Theories
#### 5.3.1 Hierarcy of Needs
The Hierarcy of Needs methodology is a motivational theory comprimising five levels of the human needs. This is often dipicted as a five layer hirarcal pyramid and is divided into deficiency and growth needs:

1. Physiological – these needs must be met in order for a person to survive, such as food, water and shelter.
2. Safety – including personal and financial security and health and wellbeing.
3. Love/belonging – the need for friendships, relationships and family.
4. Esteem – the need to feel confident and be respected by others.
5. Self-actualisation – the desire to achieve everything you possibly can and become the most that you can be.

The theory states that you must be in good health, safe and secure with meaningful relationships and confidence before you are at your very best [2].

#### 5.3.2 Two-Factor Theory
The Two-Factor Theory or Dual-Factor theory, developed in the 1950s by psychologist Frederick Herzberg, states that there are certain factors that influence job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction.

1. Motivator factors – Simply put, these are factors that lead to satisfaction and motivate employees to work harder. Examples might include enjoying your work, feeling recognised and career progression.
2. Hygiene factors – These factors can lead to dissatisfaction and a lack of motivation if they are absent. Examples include salary, company policies, benefits, relationships with managers and co-workers.

It is also noted that these factors work independantly to each other, where the motivator factors increased satisfaction while present and the hygiene factors increased satisfaction when absent.

#### 5.3.3 Comparison of the two theories
The relations and differences of these two theroies are essentially based on what drives them; both are somewhat similar with how they are percieved, where both require needs to gain motivation. To have the user work to their absolute best, they would essiently need motivators to gain motivation and would have to be given from others, with appreciation and support to make them work to the best.

The differences come from their needs entirely. The Two-factor theory basically states the needs of the person is what motivates them, what forces them to drive the person to work more from their work, whereas the Hierarcy of Needs theory is based on human needs, with the five levels of needs that the person should have to be motivated at their very best, A general idea of needs that the theory states.

What the Hierarcy doesn't state within its theory are what factors the worker has which reinforces motivation unlike the two-factor theory, where the needs of the worker reinforces a positive attitude towards their work. The two factor delves into the point where the the worker could be dissatisfied if these factors are lost.

In the ZSL project, feedback and support from fellow members proved to be a greater work force, exactly where the theories above correlate with this project. The idea of our needs to help support us was present within the development of our project and with its absence, proved to make an impact on the project. As it was our first proper project with a real client, I felt like the team was starting to be recognised; a need that would get us to work harder and this altered the way we saw the project in a more positive light. A level from the Hierarcy of Needs was also incorporated into our working, suitably the top most level, where we strived for a good outcome and felt that we have worked beyond our capabilities to provide our client with the application.

### 5.4 Team Dynamics
Team dynamics are an essential part of a project, mainly because of group orientated work being used in order to organize and develop the project where the tasks are seperated into different memebers of a group and ideas are shared. This is essiential to the success or failure towards a specific project and can massively affect the reputation of not only the group employees, but the entire company where the project can make or break it, even affecting the reputation of individual members of the group.

If the team have performed to the best of their abilities; their collaborative work towards the project is to high expectation and the other aspects, such as communication, team building and deadlines, then rest assured that the reputation is positively affected, bringing recognition to them in the long run and creating a standard to which the company that they work for is in a positive light. However, team dynamics can also bring a harsh impact, where factors such as uncooperative team members, missed deadlines and multiple delays can affect the standard of work within a project, leading to improvements being promised and not being of presentable quality towards the client. The negative standard can impact the company and/or the individuals within the company.

### 5.5 Role and Contribution
In the project, I was mainly on the visual aspect, working alongside another member with the graphics but mainly responsible for the overall visual style of the application. The team wanted something along the lines of a comic book style to go along with the original idea of the application, to which I proposed a realistic-comic hybrid style that the team agreed with, where the idea would be to take real images and incorporate the visual style into them. The lack of communication was a problem, until meeting up with the team again, the visual aspect had to be reworked to fit in with my intended style, however, time could of been given for the other members if I had given my progress to them through messaging and emails. It wasn't all negative however, as my design still made it into the final application.

I also had to deal with the initial concept; what the interface and menus would look like. I designed both the menu and the application which went through numerous changes until it reached a point of what would match the comic book style and reflect on the client organisation. When presented, the client liked the overall design of the menus and agreed with most of the choices the team and I have chosen, save for how the greenhouse meter would be used based on mechanics. Though positive, I feel as if I should of consulted the team on the designs to see if they would have faired better under what the team's thoughts and what they would've reckoned on how the designs should of looked, which in turn provided a better outcome when displaying to the client.

### 5.6 Project Evaluation
The project was more or less a huge challenge to complete, however has not cemented full approval of the client dispite the positive feedback. The project presented has gone through many changes during development, which comes down to many factors, time was being a main factor. Other factors included within the development of this application was presentation; would the app fit the clients demonstration.

Based on the original design documentation, the original app was designed to be an interactive comic book with a superhero protagonist, where the user (being the school pupil) had the choice between a hero and heroine and choosing between 4 habitats to save. A storyline was also considered; a villian called the climate Menace was polluting the Earth and the superhero along with the user must help to destroy him. Cutscenes were layed out inbetween the interactive parts, detailing how the Climate Menace was destroying parts of a certain habitat along with facts surrounding greenhouse gases and pollution that surrounded said habitat, which were part of the dialogue between the two characters.

The game segment was originally something akin to hidden object or "Where's Wally?", where the user has to find the offending things linked in with pollution. A [game mockup](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Game%20HUD%20Mockup.png) details exactly what it was supposed to look like. The user locates what they should search for at the bottom and they have to search it against a time limit of 5 minutes. Once completed, then it will continue to the rest of the story and then the habitat is completed, with the pupils moving on until all 4 habitats are completed.
The final game is vastly different to the original idea, all elements of the superhero story has been removed for a more factual based story and the game is now a drag and drop puzzle, matching the panels from the cutscene in order. The only elements from the original idea that remains is the comic book aesthetic and the name. The reason for this huge change is mainly because of time constraints and what we could actually do when developing the game. The development time was short, at 5 weeks and designing the game taking up half that time, so development was a bit rushed in order to reach the deadline and the pledges could not be implemented yet. The sprint backlogs seen above show the changes and introduce the newer features for the app. Simplicity was also a factor, creating the game was more of a challenge for us and the original segment could've been too challenging for the intended audience, so features were cut back slightly. If the time needed was longer for about 2 months or so, then the application would've have more features and would end up looking more professionally developed, helping us understand Unity better to take advantage of the features. I find that the reason for simplifying the application was a good call because it best suit the teams style of development, allowing us to focus more without the need for extra features, and helps us with developing within the exact amount of time, rather than us resorting to endless work via crunch time development. The issue though is that we may of oversold the pitch towards the client, offering features that didn't end up in the final app, which may of been a minor, if not major, reason why the app wasn't eventually picked up.

Communication between the team was lacking most meaning that work outside the workplace wasn't up to the standard as the development within the workplace when the team was all together. The only times of communication were mainly check ups on progress of development in our chosen roles and even then the decision of what to do next came out from what we thought individually rather than what we should do to support the group's progress. There was certain times we did organize tasks to progress further, but those were far and few between. I feel like the team as a whole, including me, could've had constant communication to help with steady and ordered developement and to regularily check on the progress, offer suggestions as to what else to do. The lack of communication surprisingly had not a bad lasting effect on the development being that any work that was decided by individually were adapted slightly into the design via a few tweaks, allowing us to develop an idea further.

Overall, the development of the application was very good, despite the challenging nature of said developemnt. We almost worked to the best of our abilities, but we reckon that the limiting deadline and unfamiliarity with the development engine, alongside lack of communication was the reason the application wasn't to the highest standards that we and possibly the client expected, but none the less it recieved positive feedback though wasn't selected for the final choice.

### 5.7 Process to Give Critical Reasoning
The method used to critically assess my evaluation was mainly to determine if the outcome of my choices were appropriate given the tasks at hand. Upon looking back at my roles in this project, I analysed every piece of my work that was relevent to the design and actual creation of the project and the documentation, particularly the backlogs as tasks of the project, where I was questioning the actions of development, such as why I took this role or what the reason was for particular contributions. To determine the overall evaluation, I was also looking at how my team did in response to my role, analysing the documentation at hand, their roles and contributions and even the demo delivered to our client. These methods of anaylsing was more or less a good basis to come up with my evaluation and questioning on my roles and the team, as they detail what went into the development of the project and provided an overall documentation of the team's records and downfalls with the project, with other details that we looked into, such as the limited timeframe, to give as much of an honest review of the project and justifications of the roles we took. However, the methods that went into the process weren't as much of a way to state accuruately on our performance and didn't help clarify on the improvements that would've helped the whole team.

Going into why the methods weren't as much to aid in a better evaluation to help the team as a whole, there are other methods that would've helped improve upon the process and aid in a better evaluation of the project, particualarly feedback on the project and from other members about how they felt about the development of the project or on how we as individuals worked. With this, it would've helped in the process of critical reasoning to help with a better evaluation of the project and would aided further with outlining improvements that we would work on in regards to another project.
