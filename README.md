## 1. Design History
Version 1.0

Produced by Matthew Sides, Sam Dearing, Luke Bruni, Luke Shead and Joe William

01/11/2017

## 2. Management

### 2.1 Introduction

This document specifies a design for the conceptual features and mechanics (gameplay) of a game with the provisional title “Greenhouse Menace”, commissioned by the Zoological Society of London. It is based on elements discussed in various meetings, held since 2nd October, between cliental (ZSL) and group members involving Matthew, Sam, Joe, Luke and Luke.

### 2.2 Scope

This documentation is meant to be read by programmers, artists and producers involved in the design implementation and testing of “Greenhouse Menace”. The App is for a target age of 12-15 year olds, along with this the app has to be very informative and interactive, ZSL required these for the app to be successful.

### 2.3 Overview
The project came about after a client came to us, following a request for the class to develop an app for the target audience during their visit to the London or Whipsnade Zoo. The client was part of the Zoological Society of London and had tasked other colleges and universities with creating an application similar.

The idea was to create an app that would look appealing to kids between the target age of 12-15 year olds, surrounding the effect of greenhouse gases on the earth and focusing on climate change. The app had to be focused on the four areas at which are climate change could affect said environment and what consequence it has, as well as how to reduce the effects in that environment. This effectively delvers a message to the kids, keeping in mind what the factors of climate change, what causes it and how to prevent it.

The app that best suits what the client is looking for, would eventually be used for ZSL for future education trips. Said application would be used in both the Whipsnade and London Zoo.

### 2.4 Cost

The development will be carried out on PC so no license will be required whatsoever. Unity Pro, the game engine that the app will be developed on, costs £125 a month per person, to the subtotal of £625 and taking into consideration of the amount of time needed to develop the game, which was two weeks brings the cost to £1,250.

### 2.5 Aims and Objectives
#### 2.5.1 Aims

* Create a method of interaction for the user of the app.
* Have a way to provide accurate information to the user of the application of the effects of Greenhouse gases.
* Implement a system that will allow for pledges to be made.

#### 2.5.2 Objectives
* Create a Drag and drop game that allows the users to create greenhouse chains. These will mainly be images that goes in a certain pattern according to the information from the comic parts of the app. This will be developed within three weeks, mainly to help test and develop this function fully. If all four drag and drop sections work accordingly, allowing for complete greenhouse chains, then it will be successfully implemented. This should be ready on 1st November 2017.
* Create a comic book story that will be shown as cutscenes in the game. The cutscenes will be designed in Photoshop and facts of the greenhouse gases and climate change will be researched. This will take around a week to produce, around the same time as the GUI and will give us time for additional research. Once all four sections have cutscenes and match the design requirements, they will be implement to each environment. This should be ready for the 30th October 2017.
* Create a pledge system that will allow for the user to create pledges to help improve the environment. This will be created to encourage users to reduce doing things that could potentially harm the environment. This will take a week to produce, mainly towards the end of the development. Once all four environments have working pledge systems that the user can make, then it can be implemented into the base app. This will be delivered on the 5th November 2017.

### 2.6 Time
#### 2.6.1 Gantt Chart
![First Gantt](https://github.com/RebootGames/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Gantt%20Chart.PNG)

The chart here shows how the time was laid out over each task and managed over the course of the entire project, showcasing how much time we planned to spend on and also showing the pre allocated time for the risks of the project that could come up, thus allowing contingency times just in case.

The Gantt Chart is effective because it showcases what the tasks at hand are and a good estimate amount of time dedicated to it. Also noting that using the chart is that we can see what is due and when the next task can start, organizing the team further and not in any way confusing anyone with what tasks we should do at what time, which could very likely plague the project with delays or poor quality work. It also keeps a good eye on each milestone and gives a good heads up for decision-makers and ensure that the project is working up to the requirements.

#### 2.6.2 Burndown Chart
![Burndown Chart](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Burndown%20Chart.PNG)

The Burndown chart shows the status of time it took for completing the project. The straight, black line is the predicted amount of time that it would take to complete the task and the red line is the actual pace that the project went in comparison. As demonstrated by the red line in comparison to the black, the development was lacking slightly, but was then caught up and finished before the actual deadline.

Burndown charts are effective in the sense that that they derive from the project backlogs, providing a good representation of the key data, which is the remaining work. The work in the actual line presented, shows that progress is being made and motivates the team; the line going ever closer to zero and considering if they are behind, would work harder to either reach the ideal line or before where it ends.

### 2.7 Communication and Quality
#### 2.7.1 Communication
Over the three weeks to develop the app, the members will come together over the three working days we have at college, where we can work together on the project, ensuring that the tasks done by the other members are being worked on and even lending a hand if a problem arises. Other methods of communication can be used if we are absent from the college, such as mobile phones full quick calls or discussions with one member and Facebook Messenger to talk online about the progress and even continuing the work, mainly sending pictures or files indicating the progress.

#### 2.7.2 Quality Assurance
As software developers and game designers at Reboot Games, it is vital to ensure that the product that the client requests is well developed and functions as standard to the requirements. Quality will be attained through updating the clients on development of the product, to know what is developed and allowing the client to make changes were possible. Tests will be carried out to ensure functionality, ease of use and whether they stand to the client’s requirements. Prototypes and demos will be produced to show to the client how the final product should function and look like, as well as showing the capabilities of the team. These actions will be carried out to ensure a finalized, stable and functional product that fits the client’s needs.

### 2.8 Risks
| No. | Risk | Probability | Severity | Risk Effect | Contingency/Mitigation |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Scope Creep | 40% | Moderate | Original objectives and ideas may gradually expand to the point where the project may take far longer or have a possibility of failure. Scope creep may happen because of poor understanding of the original project, changes within the market or even competing forces within a company. | To prevent the risk of scope creep, ideas will be set and seen that they are followed with no major change. Any minor change is allowed, but with careful consideration, so factors like timelines are reworked slightly or more time is given to allow for this change. This in turn should help prevent any extreme scope creep. |
| 2 | Hardware/software issues | 20% | Significant | Issues here maybe storage devices are missing, damaged or corrupt files, that hinder the project greatly because of important files becoming unavailable, having to start again from scratch. The PC or router would be damaged or flat out stop working, causing huge delays in the project until they are repaired or replaced. | Storage backups will be used in case of any failure to the storage devices mentioned in 1.5.1. There will also be backup storage of the backups in case of an extreme outcome of the risk. In regards to internet failure with the router being broken, again the backups will help should there be any cloud files that cannot be accessed and the research portion of the project will be carried out first as hopefully the development of the game doesn't require internet connection, even the multiplayer portion. As mentioned in 1.3.3, there are two computers, the software can be installed on both computers with the same license so should a computer break down, the other will be used in place so the project can continue. |
| 3 | Cost Management | 35% | Catastrophic | During the project, issues such as lack of software or, in an unlikely case, changing ISPs to help with the internet may interfere with the original budget and cashing out for features or software for the product, with the risk of the project going over budget and the project failing because of it. | In case of the cost going too high, an extra amount is kept until anything comes up. This amount accounts for about half of the original budget. Also, the aims were considered carefully based on what I could use and the purhcases were already made. |
| 4 | Misinterpretation of Client’s Ideas | 20% | Significant | When gathering the requirements, there is a possibility of misunderstanding the client’s requirements. This can result in a demanding time with development and either have created a product that does not match the proper requirements or, at worst, the project failing. | Listening closely to the client will help gather the right information to create the product. Noting down the requirements will help with breaking it down into practical tasks and overall a better understanding to help with development. |

### 2.9 ZSL Project Backlog
Group Details

Group Name: Ducks and Bucks

Group Members: Luke Shead, Joe Williams, Sam Dearing, Matthew Sides, Luke Bruni

##### 2.9.1 Project Definition
Create an app for ZSL that teaches students how greenhouse gases are produced and how they affect certain habitats. Students will be required, at the end of the session, to create a pledge of how they can reduce their greenhouse footprint.
Project Specification

ZSL has given us the task of creating a web based application for children aged 11-16 which will be used in their climate change sessions. The purpose of the app is to teach students how greenhouse gases are produced and the effects they have of habitats and show them what they/society can do to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases. The app will need to include 4 habitats with their own greenhouse chain that will be displayed to the user: Artic (Plastic Bottles), British Wildlife(Beef), Ocean (Leaving electronics on standby/oil rigging), rainforest (Mobile phones). At the end of the app students will need to create ‘pledges’ of how they will reduce their greenhouse footprint.

#### 2.9.3 Monday 2nd October - 8th October
We first started with a 1-hour sprint to put our ideas together, we began brainstorming ideas of what the main gameplay of the game would be. We decided to go with an item finding game where the user would have to find certain items in environments, which would give the user information based on each item (how greenhouse gases are created by the item etc.). We also decided on a main menu where the user would be able to decide which environment they would be using (this would depend on the environment table they are at in the ZSL session). We then spent the rest of the week fine tuning this idea and creating concepts of how the app interface would look. In our second sprint on the 5th we then decided on the aesthetic of the app, we decided upon using a comic book style as we felt that would be appealing for the children using the app.

This week’s sprints first started with our group meeting and discussing what we had achieved before the first week, Luke Shead had created the pitch presentation, Joe and Matthew had created some storyboards of how the app would function, Luke Bruni had created some concept art of the main menu and the artic habitat background and Sam had started the backlog of the previous sprints we had completed. Once we had confirmed that the tasks from last week were complete, we then assigned each other tasks that we needed to complete within a 45-minute timeframe (See in table sprint 1). This sprint was focused on our pitch and adding details to certain parts of our pitch, for example we needed to add more details to our storyboard to include the part where the students would give their pledges. Once we had completed the tasks we took an hour break then moved onto our second sprint. This sprint was more focused on how we would manage our project (see in table sprint 2); a way we are doing this is by creating user stories, so we have clear simple tasks that we can complete in our sprints.

#### 2.9.6 Monday 17th Concept Pitch
At this time, we were instructed to meet with our client in regards to our pitch ideas and showcase what we have in mind for the application. In order to present the client with the designs in mind, a PowerPoint presentation was devised by Luke Shead, to showcase the design of the app and what it's functions are, showing what we are doing to fulfil the client's requirements. Within the PowerPoint detailed the most important aspects of development including concept art and how the initial app will look like. These designs and functions of the application would be reviewed by the client and her thoughts on the design would be shared to us.

##### 2.9.6.1 Communication methods
When giving the event for the client, numerous communication methods were used to ensure that the information we were giving to the client was received clearly and understood.

###### Visual
The presentation was used as a visual aid when giving the pitch to the client, allowing us to show pictures of the application. This helped with giving the client a visual representation of the application and to give her a realistic outcome of the project rather than for her to imagine what it would look like and not deliver what was promised.

###### Verbal
Alongside the PowerPoint, the slides were also aided by a member of the team giving the presentation, telling a more detailed account of the application where the visual aspect lacked. This was done to give a detailed and clearer account using the visual presentation as aid to both the presenter and client where the more intricate details would be spoken.

###### Physical
A demo of the application was given to give a clearer understanding of what we were trying to do and to help the client follow along with the presentation rather than just relying solely on the presentation alone.

###### Non-Verbal (Body Language)
This was used mainly to help clear up any uncertain points, mainly by pointing to parts of the presentation and also to engage in the next part. Body language was also there to show a certain level of enthusiasm demonstrated by the team member, Luke Shead, showing a huge level of interest that would certainly make the client satisfied.

###### Effectiveness
As stated earlier, the event was to present our pitch to the client at ZSL, for their thoughts of what we created for the design of the app. Our audience for the presentation was the client and the other employees at ZSL, as the app basically is designed for the ZSL organisation which is imperative that it's designed the way they want and presented in a way that they would understand and stay interested in, hopefully to get the client on board with our design.

The communication methods were effective in the presentation because overall, it helped the client with perfectly understanding the design we had gone for and picking up on the application. Visual Communication in the presentation was effective as it showcased an actual design, helping the client understand what we were trying to do. Verbal communication was also effective because it gave a more accurate explanation of what we were trying to do design and function-wise with the application, which gave the client a broader understanding of each feature of the application. The physical communication presented was mainly body language, which was also effective because it showed a high level of enthusiasm to the client, basically displaying to them that we were interested in the application. The hand outs were effective because it provided an extra layer of information to the client, as well as being a backup in case at any time, presenting the app went wrong.

In other ways using these methods were effective because had it not been for using said methods, the client would've been sceptical and wouldn't back the application. The client was looking primarily for confidence within presenting, so it is vital to pitch an idea to the client using the communication methods with hope that the client would be taken with the pitch and the professionalism of the person pitching to them. That is why the communication methods used were effective, because from this, the client did consider and accept the idea that we presented, further adding feedback to what we had designed. Again, during the feedback, the communication methods were effective because it shown that we positively took note of them and accepted them for the main app presentation later and that gave the client trust in us that we would ultimately deliver something that client considered.

##### 2.9.6.2 Substantial Risks
Issues had arisen during the finalizing of the PowerPoint presentation; the transferring of the presentation had caused some problems as the initial presentation was created in google docs then transferred over to Microsoft PowerPoint. By the time the pitch had started, the problems were ironed out in the end. Should the presentation not have been ready by that time because of these problems, physical handouts were created in case containing all the information of the application that was necessary, given alongside the presentation in case the client had missed some information or had wanted the full picture of the app.

#### 2.9.7 30th October-7th November

## 3. Design

### 3.1 The Planning

In order to get the correct product to the client, the team met up and made sure that we were all on the same page when it came to the same IDE's we would be using to the right programming language and what timetable that we would have. We met on several occasions regarding points about the app and how it would work, the first meeting was for information on the project, this was followed by a pitch meeting, this was where we had a design for our app. Through our presentation we were able to accurately show how the app was going to work, this allowed for feedback in what was good and bad in our app and we were able to use that for improvement to the app.

Before meetings there where some issues with the PowerPoint presentation as it had been created in google docs then transferred over to Microsoft PowerPoint, however those problems where managed to be fixed before the pitch had started. As well as this the group made handouts for the clients to make sure that any information that was missed or not communicated properly would still be showed to the client. With these handouts we were able to resolve an issue with the app before it was too late to have any big impact on the design process.

After meeting we made sure to cover all of the risks and problems that we could encounter on the project. For example, if someone was to have issues with a certain part of building the program, would there be help from the team and if so, was there flexibility within the group to help. We took these risk into consideration and tried to make technical solutions to each of them. With us doing this it meant that most of the risks that could have been prevented were, this process saved much time and resources and allowed us to use our time much more effectively in the project.

### 3.2 Feedback

On parts of the ZSL project, there were meetings on the project to show what the app was looking like and if it was going in the right direction of what they wanted. The feedback that our group got on the first pitch was very eye-opening as it showed us that we had been going in a wrong direction with our app. The feedback that we got that our app was not informative enough and interactive sides of it were lacking allowed us to look back at our app and make changes to the app to fit the client’s needs. This included changing the interactive side of it completely as well as adding in more parts to make it more informational.

### 3.3 Concept

The aim is to produce a game which suits the client’s requirements, creating an educational application that is informative, engaging and interactive based on the proposed or pre-set subject (In this instance; Greenhouse gases, production, Manufacturing and the impact of said gases and manufacturing or production phases on the environment in addition to the influence on climate change). 

#### 3.3.1 Menu and Game A.I

The project app had its age group towards 11-16 with more emphasis towards the KS3 pupils, so the design we figured called for something that was cartoony and bright, mainly to appeal to said younger audience, but was more modern and reflects on the image of ZSL, which should appeal more to the older KS4, if not the public. The design we figured would work would be a more comic book style, which should appeal to the audience. Other elements would also reflect the image of ZSL but wouldn’t obstruct the original aesthetic of the app.

The menu would be fairly easy to look at and simple to use. The bright vivid colours and the comic book style in the background (The landscapes in the picture are evident of the style) help with the overall design and should appeal to the younger audience, eye catching and not at all dull. The menu elements reflect on more modern designs and generally makes that app appear neater, but as stated, doesn’t interrupt the comic book style design. The greenhouse gas meter would be present mostly and will change based on pupils’ choices of greenhouse reduction, with the lock allowing them to access the “Reduction constructor” and the pledges page once a section has been completed.

![HUD](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Game%20HUD%20Mockup.png)

This shows the game’s UI, again using the design mentioned above. The user would have to try to find all 12 of the carbon emissions or “Hazards” in 5 minutes. Once the “Hazard” is found and selected, it will stand out from the rest of the elements and information will appear, giving a brief explanation of how the “Hazard” is contributing to carbon and greenhouse emissions or other factors of climate change and may impact on the greenhouse gas meter at the top. The elements will be hidden specifically to be enjoyable to the user and not at all too challenging.

### 3.4 Story 

The story relates to the greenhouse gases and chain, of the production and manufacturing process of four products to four habitats. The user is presented with the production and manufacturing process or segments of the greenhouse gas chain and are then responsible or asked to recreate the chain after viewing the process once. Moreover, once the chain is completed the user is then presented with what could be done to help alleviate the problem or rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted, which links in to the pledges the user is then shown and asked to pick at least one pledge to enact in their daily lives.

### 3.5 Setting

This game will be set in the present/modern day. 

### 3.6 Application Structure

The Menu will consist of four images, each representing a different area or environment. 
In the application all areas will be unlocked automatically to give the user a choice as to which area they may want to begin with.

![Game Menu](https://github.com/LukeShead/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Mockup%20App%20Menu.png)

Furthermore, the graphic styles within the environments and menu will be consistent throughout, though what is represented within each area and the colour palette will change so that differentiation may be made for the 4 different areas (Tundra, Rain Forest, British countryside and the Ocean).

Once an area or habitat has been clicked on a comic strip will be shown spanning one to two scenes (pages) showing the manufacturing and production process of a product relevant to that environment. Moreover, after the comic strips have faded the game screen will appear with an empty chain and numerous images that can be manipulated by the user, which need to be put by a user in a specific order. 

After the greenhouse gas chain has been completed and put into the correct order, more images are presented showing what could be done to help alleviate the amount of gases released, with pledges then being presented once the images have been removed from the screen with the user given a choice.

Moreover, once a pledge has been chosen the user will then be taken (transitioned) back to the main menu screen.

### 3.7 Players | Platform

The application will adhere to 11-16 year olds, being compatible on the following system;

Apple-IPAD-IOS-Chrome

The application itself though not built with multiplayer, may be used by multiple people through sharing one system or machine and straightforward discussion (as to what should be inputted).

### 3.8 Genre

	2D

	Educational

	Memory Game

### 3.9 Intended Audience

The intended audience of the game is for casual or non-gamers of all genders spanning from the age of 11 to 16, however the primary age range is 11 to 12 years old.

### 3.10 Sound Consideration

The game is not sound dependant since it was requested by the client (no sound or audio).

### 3.11 Language

The only language available in the game will be English. 

### 3.12 Camera

The camera will be projected from a 2D front side angle of the menu, comics, pledges and chain.

### 3.13 General Movement

The users will be able to drop and drag certain objects across the screen (for the chain segment).
Whilst users will also be able to use the tap function (on the menu and comic slides to transition between scenes).

### 3.14 Fonts

In game Font: 
Jupiter (Menu, Game Screen)
.... (Comic Font)


## 4. Evaluation
### 4.1 How User and Software Requirements Have Been Addressed
When a development methodology has been declared, structuring the work is then the issue. Within Agile Development, the work is divided into four sections to bring the structure of the project. The structure is this:

* Epic - The large body of work and mainly the main objective. Within this are stories.
* Stories - Small work units or tasks that are done to make up the epic.
* Version - The release of the software
* Sprint - The iteration where the team then come together to work.

Using these sections helps break down the requirements and lays them out into workable parts for the software teams. In addition, it can help with prioritizing customer feedback and can change the plan around without having a negative impact.

Epics are the larger bodies that the stories are contained in and make up. Versions are made from different epics being a point in time to where the software is released. These can change over the course of the project being part of agile development and are created through the development and feedback, where the user stories are added, changed or removed to optimize the release time.

In regard to the ZSL project, the requirements we gathered start off as an epic that is used for the key features, such as the interactive portion or the four habitats. The epics give us an idea of what should be included, but to ensure that we can successfully implement it, they are broken down further into the stories; the drag and drop section, the creation of images, assigning menu buttons, etc. until they make up the epic. Should the task still be a lot more work than considered, it is broken down further into subtasks. All tasks and subtasks are made up into the epics and all individually implemented to build the initial app. Each example of tasks and sprints made from the requirements are noted in the project’s backlog, detailing each task and the roles of each member when working in the sprint.

### 4.2 Problem Solving Techniques used in the design and delivery
* Breaking down a problem/decomposition - Understanding the problem and breaking it down into individual tasks or aims by going from the best ideas from members of the team.

In regards to the development of the application, we had to understand the requirements of what the client wanted. After the first meeting with the client, the requirements became clear to us and we can finally start piecing together a plan. The client wanted specific features that would be included in the application, but weren't fully realized and we didn't know a starting point on how the feature would work, so the team broke down the requirement into that of an epic and then broke that down to form user stories to help us comprehend how to implement the feature. These user stories would eventually be made into aims with various deadlines and different people working on it, helping us get closer to the requirements that the client wanted.

* Trial and error - Working with different ideas and methods and continue through thick and thin until a more desired solution is met.

In the ZSL project, we were a bit inexperienced with the software resources and thus tried to experiment with Unity until something was bound to work. This also was done to try to understand the engine better and help with tweaking the application where we thought it lacked. This method in turn helped us learn more and improved upon experience, but we wouldn't consider again due to the complexity and varied amount of time that this method would take up.

* Teamwork and communication - Working within a team to achieve a set goal, along with communicating with others about the task at hand or offering suggestions to aid the development.

Teamwork and communication was the main point of the entire project, where we could rely on each other to achieve a project goal. In the project, roles were taken up as to who will do what part of the application, such as the graphics, coding, etc. and each task was looked over by each member to see how well it was coming along.

Communication was more or less another vital part of the development, allowing us to talk amongst the team members to find out how the task was going, if it was done or any other suggestion to the problem. Speaking with the client was also as major benefit as it allowed us to understand what sort of app that she wanted.

#### 4.2.1 Tools used in the design and delivery

* Photoshop - Image manipulation tool that can allow for the creation of images and other graphics. For the purpose of the project, this was used to create the comic book graphics for the game, by graphic designer Luke Bruni. This was done by merging provided images into one layer, then using Photoshop’s pre-set filters to differentiate the images from the originals and ensure that the graphics were applicable and suitable to the aesthetic requested and set to be used in the design and creation of the application.

* Unity - Software development program for the development of games and other applications. This was used for the overall development of our application, chosen because of its benefits and the ease of use.

* Powerpoint - Software that allows for the creation of presentations by Microsoft. This was used for developing the presentations that would be used for the meetings with the client to showcase the development of the app.

### 4.3 Motivational Theories
#### 4.3.1 Hierarchy of Needs
The Hierarchy of Needs methodology is a motivational theory compromising five levels of the human needs. This is often depicted as a five-layer hierarchal pyramid and is divided into deficiency and growth needs:

1. Physiological – these needs must be met in order for a person to survive, such as food, water and shelter.
2. Safety – including personal and financial security and health and wellbeing.
3. Love/belonging – the need for friendships, relationships and family.
4. Esteem – the need to feel confident and be respected by others.
5. Self-actualisation – the desire to achieve everything you possibly can and become the most that you can be.

The theory states that you must be in good health, safe and secure with meaningful relationships and confidence before you are at your very best [2].

#### 4.3.2 Two-Factor Theory
The Two-Factor Theory or Dual-Factor theory, developed in the 1950s by psychologist Frederick Herzberg, states that there are certain factors that influence job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction.

1. Motivator factors – Simply put, these are factors that lead to satisfaction and motivate employees to work harder. Examples might include enjoying your work, feeling recognised and career progression.
2. Hygiene factors – These factors can lead to dissatisfaction and a lack of motivation if they are absent. Examples include salary, company policies, benefits, relationships with managers and co-workers.

It is also noted that these factors work independently to each other, where the motivator factors increased satisfaction while present and the hygiene factors increased satisfaction when absent.

#### 4.3.3 Comparison of the two theories
The relations and differences of these two theories are essentially based on what drives them; both are somewhat similar with how they are perceived, where both require needs to gain motivation. To have the user work to their absolute best, they would essentially need motivators to gain motivation and would have to be given from others, with appreciation and support to make them work to the best.

The differences come from their needs entirely. The Two-factor theory basically states the needs of the person is what motivates them, what forces them to drive the person to work more from their work, whereas the Hierarchy of Needs theory is based on human needs, with the five levels of needs that the person should have to be motivated at their very best, A general idea of needs that the theory states.

What the Hierarchy doesn't state within its theory are what factors the worker has which reinforces motivation unlike the two-factor theory, where the needs of the worker reinforce a positive attitude towards their work. The two factor delves into the point where the worker could be dissatisfied if these factors are lost.

In the ZSL project, feedback and support from fellow members proved to be a greater work force, exactly where the theories above correlate with this project. The idea of our needs to help support us was present within the development of our project and with its absence, proved to make an impact on the project. As it was our first proper project with a real client, I felt like the team was starting to be recognised; a need that would get us to work harder and this altered the way we saw the project in a more positive light. A level from the Hierarchy of Needs was also incorporated into our working, suitably the top most level, where we strived for a good outcome and felt that we have worked beyond our capabilities to provide our client with the application.

### 4.4 Team Dynamics
Team Dynamics are the relationships and forces that drive the team's behaviour and performance, including the relationships between members and how it impacts the performance. This is essential to the success or failure towards a specific project and can massively affect the reputation of not only the group employees, but the entire company and even affecting the reputation of individual members of the group.

Different team dynamics can have either have the same impacts as mentioned earlier, and are the foundations to either both a successful or failed project. The relationships of a team could either have positive or adverse effects to the project and completely change the workplace environment depending on how they work together. An example being that in a team of five working on a project and how the team contribute. These five people could know each other throughout their lives, knowing on their strengths and weaknesses of each other and this could either play out in two ways; the team understand each member, leading to eventual support of each other and ultimately, work best where their strengths lie, creating a stable working environment and provide good motivation; or increasing conflict throughout the team, leading to arguments with each other and this can be down to a member not working to what the team or requirements expect or a light work load compared to the rest of the team, ultimately affecting the performance of each member and the relationships could rapidly deteriorate as well as even quitting an organisation because of this.

Any individual person in a team can have either a positive or negative impact towards team dynamics which leading to the success or failure of a project. If that person has a positive effect on the project, then they can be the team player, the best working person who understands the rest of the team and has good relations towards the team. This person can affectively help out the team and have a good contribution towards the project. On the other hand, that person could be the person who has a negative relation to everyone in the team, often disagreeing with people's ideas, joking at inappropriate times or ultimately, trying to block the progress of the project, leading to the project becoming delayed or failing because of one person's distrust or poor relationship with each person.

If the team have performed to the best of their abilities; their collaborative work towards the project is to high expectation and the other aspects, such as communication, team building and deadlines, then rest assured that the reputation is positively affected, bringing recognition to them in the long run and creating a standard to which the company that they work for is in a positive light. However, team dynamics can also bring a harsh impact, where factors such as uncooperative team members, missed deadlines and multiple delays can affect the standard of work within a project, leading to improvements being promised and not being of presentable quality towards the client. The negative standard can impact the company and/or the individuals within the company.

### 4.5 Role and Contribution
In the project, I was mainly on the visual aspect, working alongside another member with the graphics but mainly responsible for the overall visual style of the application. I had chosen the role of creating the visuals because I had more experience in the art aspect as opposed to the other elements of the project such as coding, though I did help with offering a couple of features to the game such as the greenhouse meter function in the form of a prototype. Ultimately, I was in charge of the art dynamic of the game as I thought it would be helpful to the team as compared to the rest of the team, I had more experience of graphics because of practice outside of college. I decided that all art was going to be in Photoshop, as compared to just drawing because I felt that by using Photoshop, I would be able to create some art that would perfectly convey what the client wanted, something that mere sketch-ups wouldn't achieve. A personal reason as to why I chose Photoshop was, again, experience outside of college and the features would assist me more, though I do feel that my skill could be transferred to similar photo-editing software like GIMP, because it would be a useful backup if Photoshop were to ultimately fail. With my skills in Photoshop, I would consider this as an advantage to the project as I don't need to take up valuable time trying to learn it and can get straight to working on the aims.

The team wanted something along the lines of a comic book style to go along with the original idea of the application, to which I proposed a realistic-comic hybrid style that the team agreed with, where the idea would be to take real images and incorporate the visual style into them. The lack of communication was a problem, until meeting up with the team again, the visual aspect had to be reworked to fit in with my intended style, however, time could of been given for the other members if I had given my progress to them through messaging and emails. It wasn't all negative however, as my design still made it into the final application.

I also had to deal with the initial concept; what the interface and menus would look like. I designed both the menu and the application which went through numerous changes until it reached a point of what would match the comic book style and reflect on the client organisation. When presented, the client liked the overall design of the menus and agreed with most of the choices the team and I have chosen, save for how the greenhouse meter would be used based on mechanics. Though positive, I feel as if I should have consulted the team on the designs to see if they would have fared better under what the team's thoughts and what they would've reckoned on how the designs should have looked, which in turn provided a better outcome when displaying to the client.

### 4.6 Justification of Methodologies

### 4.7 Tools and Techniques

### 4.8 Project Evaluation
The project was more or less a huge challenge to complete, however has not cemented full approval of the client despite the positive feedback. The project presented has gone through many changes during development, which comes down too many factors, time was being a main factor. Other factors included within the development of this application was presentation; would the app fit the client’s demonstration.

Based on the original design documentation, the original app was designed to be an interactive comic book with a superhero protagonist, where the user (being the school pupil) had the choice between a hero and heroine and choosing between 4 habitats to save. A storyline was also considered; a villain called the climate Menace was polluting the Earth and the superhero along with the user must help to destroy him. Cut scenes were laid out in-between the interactive parts, detailing how the Climate Menace was destroying parts of a certain habitat along with facts surrounding greenhouse gases and pollution that surrounded said habitat, which were part of the dialogue between the two characters.

The game segment was originally something akin to hidden object or "Where's Wally?", where the user has to find the offending things linked in with pollution. A [game mockup](https://github.com/LBruni98/ZSL-The-Climate-Menace/blob/master/Game%20HUD%20Mockup.png) details exactly what it was supposed to look like. The user locates what they should search for at the bottom and they have to search it against a time limit of 5 minutes. Once completed, then it will continue to the rest of the story and then the habitat is completed, with the pupils moving on until all 4 habitats are completed.
The final game is vastly different to the original idea, all elements of the superhero story has been removed for a more factual based story and the game is now a drag and drop puzzle, matching the panels from the cutscene in order. The only elements from the original idea that remains is the comic book aesthetic and the name. The reason for this huge change is mainly because of time constraints and what we could actually do when developing the game. The development time was short, at 5 weeks and designing the game taking up half that time, so development was a bit rushed in order to reach the deadline and the pledges could not be implemented yet. The sprint backlogs seen above show the changes and introduce the newer features for the app. Simplicity was also a factor, creating the game was more of a challenge for us and the original segment could've been too challenging for the intended audience, so features were cut back slightly. If the time needed was longer for about 2 months or so, then the application would've have more features and would end up looking more professionally developed, helping us understand Unity better to take advantage of the features. I find that the reason for simplifying the application was a good call because it best suits the teams style of development, allowing us to focus more without the need for extra features, and helps us with developing within the exact amount of time, rather than us resorting to endless work via crunch time development. The issue though is that we may have oversold the pitch towards the client, offering features that didn't end up in the final app, which may of been a minor, if not major, reason why the app wasn't eventually picked up.

Communication between the team was lacking most meaning that work outside the workplace wasn't up to the standard as the development within the workplace when the team was all together. The only times of communication were mainly check-ups on progress of development in our chosen roles and even then the decision of what to do next came out from what we thought individually rather than what we should do to support the group's progress. There were certain times we did organize tasks to progress further, but those were far and few between. I feel like the team as a whole, including me, could've had constant communication to help with steady and ordered development and to regularly check on the progress, offer suggestions as to what else to do. The lack of communication surprisingly had not a bad lasting effect on the development being that any work that was decided by individually were adapted slightly into the design via a few tweaks, allowing us to develop an idea further.

Overall, the development of the application was very good, despite the challenging nature of said development. We almost worked to the best of our abilities, but we reckon that the limiting deadline and unfamiliarity with the development engine, alongside lack of communication was the reason the application wasn't to the highest standards that we and possibly the client expected, but none the less it received positive feedback though wasn't selected for the final choice.

### 4.9 Process to Give Critical Reasoning
The method used to critically assess my evaluation was mainly to determine if the outcome of my choices were appropriate given the tasks at hand. Upon looking back at my roles in this project, I analysed every piece of my work that was relevant to the design and actual creation of the project and the documentation, particularly the backlogs as tasks of the project, where I was questioning the actions of development, such as why I took this role or what the reason was for particular contributions. To determine the overall evaluation, I was also looking at how my team did in response to my role, analysing the documentation at hand, their roles and contributions and even the demo delivered to our client. These methods of analysing were more or less a good basis to come up with my evaluation and questioning on my roles and the team, as they detail what went into the development of the project and provided an overall documentation of the team's records and downfalls with the project, with other details that we looked into, such as the limited timeframe, to give as much of an honest review of the project and justifications of the roles we took. However, the methods that went into the process weren't as much of a way to state accurately on our performance and didn't help clarify on the improvements that would've helped the whole team.

Going into why the methods weren't as much to aid in a better evaluation to help the team as a whole, there are other methods that would've helped improve upon the process and aid in a better evaluation of the project, particularly feedback on the project and from other members about how they felt about the development of the project or on how we as individuals worked. With this, it would've helped in the process of critical reasoning to help with a better evaluation of the project and would aided further with outlining improvements that we would work on in regards to another project.
